### Overview

MEV-X Homelander is a post-swap, atomic MEV internalization framework designed for direct integration with decentralized exchanges.

The system captures arbitrage opportunities generated by user trades and resolves them internally, within the same transaction, without exposing execution to the public mempool or altering the trading experience.

Homelander operates as a non-invasive execution layer, fully isolated from core AMM mechanics and compatible with modern AMM architectures that support post-swap hooks.
