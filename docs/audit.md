## Security Audit

MEV-X Homelander has undergone an independent security audit conducted by **Bailsec**, focused on the correctness and safety of its on-chain execution logic.

The audit reviewed the Homelander smart contract implemented in Solidity and designed to operate as a post-swap component within AMM architectures that support lifecycle hooks. The assessment was performed through manual code review and evaluated the contract’s behavior in the context of post-swap execution.

### Audit Scope

The audit focused on:

- Post-swap execution flow and hook invocation logic  
- Internal MEV-related execution paths and control flow  
- Access control assumptions and privilege boundaries  
- Failure handling and revert behavior  
- Interaction with AMM state after swap completion  

### Results

No security vulnerabilities were identified in the reviewed contract.

All reported observations were non-exploitable and related to general design assumptions or operational considerations rather than to flaws in execution logic.

The audit confirms that:

- The contract does not introduce execution paths that allow unauthorized access to or extraction of pool funds;  
- Internal MEV execution remains isolated from the user swap flow and does not affect swap correctness;  
- Scenarios with no valid internal backrun are handled without reverting the user transaction;  
- Administrative controls allow the component to be disabled or removed by protocol governance without impacting trading functionality.
